# UserManagementApp

This application was more of my take on learning the development of ReactJS.NET (the use of react on the client-side and .NET in the server-side). It was quite a cool learning experience creating UMA. I really appreciate how I can leverage React's expansive selection of libraries for responsive interfaces and Microsoft's backend C# framework for solid performance and easy integration with Azure. 

### Features

- Visually pleasing interface. Includes functionality to log, edit, and store users and departments.
- User and Department logs are stored in a backend SQL Database.

### Skills

- Programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C#
- Libraries/Frameworks: React.js, ASP.NET
- Database: SQL DB
